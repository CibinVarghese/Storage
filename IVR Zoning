1). check the active ivr zoneset name

show ivr zoneset active

The name of the ivr zoneset is needed because you will need to activate this zoneset again after your zone change.
The oputput will look similar to below:-

switch# show ivr zoneset active
zoneset name IVR_ZoneSet1

2). Create the new ivr zone:

config t                    
ivr zone name Host1_vsan-2_Storage1_vsan-4  

This takes you into the ivr zone sub mode for the zone name:

switch(config-ivr-zone)#

To add  member pwwns use the following command, must specify the vsan these devices are phyiscally connected

member pwwn 21:00:00:e0:8b:05:da:50 vsan 2
member pwwn 50:00:00:00:69:04:20:51 vsan 4

or 

member device-alias Host1_vsan-2 vsan 2
member device-alias Storage1_vsan-4 vsan 4

exit <--- takes you out of the zone sub mode when done editing the zone
ivr commit <--- commits the member change to the database to be activated below

3). Adding the zone as a member of the active zoneset:

To add a new zone as a member of the Active IVR zoneset, run the following commands:

ivr zoenset name IVR_ZoneSet1  <-- once again, you must provide the exact zoneset name, or it will create a diferent one.

Now you are in the zoneset editor submode

switch(config-ivr-zoneset)#   

To add a member zone to the zoneset, run this command:

member Host1_vsan-2_Storage1_vsan-4
exit
ivr distribute
ivr commit

4). Activate and commit the Active IVR zoneset
show ivr zoneset active  <--- This will show the active IVR Zoneset name
ivr zoneset activate name IVR_ZoneSet1
ivr commit
exit
copy running-config startup-config

NOTE :  This must be executed from an IVR enabled Cisco MDS switch in the fabric
